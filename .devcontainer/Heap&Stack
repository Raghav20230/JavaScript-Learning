//there are two types  of memory 
//Stack Memory[Primitive Type]=> Primitive data types and references,Size is known at compile time,Fixed memory allocated	
//Heap memory [Non Primitive Type]=>Objects and functions,Size is known at run time,No limit for object memory

//in stack jb bhe koi variable declare kra h uska koi copy milta h
//heap main milta h refrence agar kuch bhe change krege toh original value main change hota h
